## About Me

I'm trained as an engineer and am passionate about science, food, local politics, queer and feminist issues, Judaism, speculative fiction, and language. An enthusiastic researcher, I relish the opportunity to dig deep into a new topic and to make complicated technical issues accessible to lay people.

Experienced in Chicago Manual of Style, AP, and MLA. Currently available for copy editing, transcription, and writing (especially in the areas listed above, but able to quickly get up to speed on most technical topics). I would love to help your work become the best possible version of itself!

## Testimonials

> Hannah Davis is a find! Not only is he a careful and thorough editor of our technical mistakes, he brings an eye to the content that he’s working with that always makes it better than it was when we gave it to him. His hard work, attention to detail and truly amazing turn around times make him a vital part of our team. I’d say don’t hire him because I want to keep him all to myself, but everyone needs Hannah!

> Hannah did an incredible job as a copyeditor for Bossgame’s script. He was very quickly able to point out scenes I had been unsure about, and suggest both explanations and solutions. His advice was clear and easy to understand, and he was extremely reliable. With his help, I was able to make the story feel more consistent and cohesive by dropping grammatical mistakes and strange verbiage. Hannah’s work ensured the script was everything I wanted it to be. I’d highly recommend him to anyone who needs copyediting.

## Services

### Copy Editing

A close read of your almost-completed work, focusing on clarity, concision, and correctness. I'll catch typos and inconsistencies, tighten up formatting, and polish your prose (or poetry!). In the initial consult, we'll talk through the level of editing desired, the project timeline, and rates. For longer works, I will generally ask for a few pages from the middle of the work to do a sample edit, which will allow me to give you a more accurate time and budget estimate.

### Transcription

Interview or spoken-word transcriptions on a variety of topics, including technical conversations. Can be formatted for word-for-word accuracy or edited and reorganized for clarity of message.
